# Kin-Keepers
Alzheimer's voice interface to a family tree for elderly patients.

Kin-Keepers - A voice translator for Alzheimer's sufferers. Kin-Keepers’ AI/ML technology translates wrong or forgotten words into intelligible communication for people suffering from Alzheimer and dementia. A grandmother will use voice to query for the names of forgotten relatives. 

This project shows how to: 
Use a node.js server as a backend to provide all the services among different stakeholders, e.g., seniors, families and carers. 
Use Alexa along with Microsoft LUIS API for voice input. 
Use ARM mbed OS to integrate a microphone and hardware sensors on a Raspberry PI board. 
Use an HTML5 based web dashboard for access to a Family Circle where relatives can place all kinds of data.

The outcome – A Smart Parrot that listens and speaks to the elder, bringing feedback and certainty. The Smart Parrot not only aids the senior but becomes the eyes and ears for the family. Kin-Keepers’ proprietary technology offers reliable feedback for the 50 million suffering from dementia around the world; improving their lives and helping those affected live more harmoniously with families and carers
